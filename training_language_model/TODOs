# create TwitterAPI extractor for batching
# find/load/create Twitter annotator for our model (pytorch) and RoBertA
# training/test dataset creation and processing (batch)
# train second step mine + RoBertA 
# use https://huggingface.co/datasets/carblacac/twitter-sentiment-analysis for 3rd step
# third step for sentiment classification
# compare results 
# test resume training and allow to choose the run to retrain, not only the latest
# refactor code looking at TODOs
# eliminate MPS check that is not working with current PyTorch
# description of how to bootstrap remote server (https://blog.roboflow.com/nvidia-docker-vscode-pytorch/)
# create local environment for when to develop on Mac with MPS
# fix install NVIDIA drivers in Ubuntu sh
# deploy chosen model (batch pipeline)
# add performance monitoring on MLflow
# for later: try streaming pipeline (also need Twitter extractor and annotator in streaming)
# add streaming monitoring of performance on MLflow
